# Weather-Analysis
NCDC (National Climatic Data Center) which is a part of NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) manages the monitoring and makes available the datasets relating to weather for public.
Forecasting and predicting the weather has always been a tough task for meteorologists. There is very much a need for an accurate analysis and prediction of weather and is widely applicable and helpful if gained accuracy.
This project and data analysis reviews an in-depth research of weather and climatic changes every year with extensive usage of data analysis tools such as Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark. 
The problem statement is, to consider multiple factors about the climatic changes grouped with past data and to carry out an accurate analysis to predict the upcoming weather. 
The project is mainly focused on the two main pillars HDFS (Hadoop File System) and Map Reduce techniques for the analysis along with other modules of Apache Hadoop ecosystem. 
The motto of the project would be towards collecting accurate data, mining the obtained dataset and using Hadoop Ecosystem to analyze for patterns and also to use visualization tools like Excel, Tableau etc. to extract meaningful insights out of it.
AWS cloud services are used for the later analysis of this project.
